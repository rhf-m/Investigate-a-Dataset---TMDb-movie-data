# Investigate-a-Dataset-TMDb-movie-data
>Second project in Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree

>I selected TMDb movie dataset for analysis, it includes details on 10,000 movies that were gathered from The Movie Database (TMDb). This data contains 21 columns and 10,866 rows, I followed the following steps to analyzing the data of the TMDb movie:

### 1. Questions:
In this step, after I understood the data deeply, I began to ask questions based on this data. Here are the questions I asked:

1.  Which genres are most popular from year to year?
2. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
3. Is there a relationship between the number of votes and the popularity of the movie?
4. What is the highest rated movie and lowest rated movie?
5. What are the five highest budget movies?
6. What factors is correlated with runtime?
7. What factors is correlated with release date?

### 2. Data Wrangling
After I asked the questions, I moved to the Data Wrangling step, in this step I collected the information to answer the questions and I discovered problems such as: incorrect data type, missing values and duplicates values , then cleaned the data by fixing the problems in it.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Now the data is ready to answer the questions, at this stage I have answered all the questions through statistics and illustrations, then I will mention the results I reached from my analysis of TMDb movie data:
1. The highest popular genre of movies is Drama, accounting for 4760 movies.
2. The Top three popular genres of movies are Drama, Comedy and Thriller respectively.
3. The properties are associated with movies that have high revenues are popularity,vote_count and budget that is mean there is a relationship between revenue and popularity,vote_count and budget. So,revenue,popularity,vote_count and budget are dependent variables.
4. There is a positive relationship between the number of votes and the popularity of the movie.
5. The highest rated movie is 'The Story of Film: An Odyssey' with 9.2 rating.
6. The lowest rated movies are 'Transmorphers' and 'Manos: The Hands of Fate' with 1.5 rating.
7. The five highest budget movies are (The Warrior's Way, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Avengers: Age of Ultron,Superman Returns) respectively.
8. There is no relationship between runtime and other properties, which means that runtime is an independent variable that is not affected by any other variable.
9. There is no relationship between release date and other properties, which means that release date is an independent variable that is not affected by any other variable.
